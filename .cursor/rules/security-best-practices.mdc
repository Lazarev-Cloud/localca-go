# Security Best Practices

LocalCA implements security best practices for certificate management and secure operations.

## CA Security

- Private key protection with password encryption
- Key stored in secure location with restricted access
- Certificate Revocation List (CRL) management
- Regular key rotation recommendations

## Application Security

- HTTPS for web interface with TLS
- Authentication for administrative access
- Input validation for all certificate parameters
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- Secure default configurations

## Certificate Security

- Strong default key sizes (RSA 2048, ECDSA P-256)
- Modern signature algorithms (SHA-256)
- Appropriate validity periods
- Proper Subject Alternative Name (SAN) handling
- Extended Key Usage constraints

## Operational Security

- Secure deployment recommendations in [DEPLOYMENT.md](mdc:DEPLOYMENT.md)
- Network isolation guidance
- Regular backup procedures
- Monitoring and logging
- Certificate expiration notifications

## Development Security

- Dependency scanning
- Code review process
- Security testing
- Secure coding practices

## Secure Configuration

- Environment variable validation
- Secure defaults
- Configuration validation
- Secrets management
