# ACME Protocol Implementation

LocalCA implements the Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol, allowing for automated certificate issuance compatible with clients like certbot.

## ACME Server

The ACME server implementation is located in [pkg/acme](mdc:pkg/acme):

- [server.go](mdc:pkg/acme/server.go): Main ACME server implementation
- [handlers.go](mdc:pkg/acme/handlers.go): ACME API endpoint handlers
- [challenge.go](mdc:pkg/acme/challenge.go): Challenge verification
- [account.go](mdc:pkg/acme/account.go): ACME account management
- [order.go](mdc:pkg/acme/order.go): Certificate order processing

## ACME Protocol Flow

1. **Account Registration**: Client registers an account with the ACME server
2. **Order Creation**: Client creates a certificate order
3. **Challenge Issuance**: Server issues challenges to verify domain control
4. **Challenge Verification**: Client completes challenges, server verifies
5. **Certificate Issuance**: Server issues the certificate

## Supported Challenge Types

LocalCA supports the HTTP-01 challenge type:

- Client places a token at a specific HTTP location
- Server verifies the token to confirm domain control
- Challenge verification is handled in [challenge.go](mdc:pkg/acme/challenge.go)

## ACME Server Configuration

The ACME server is configured in [main.go](mdc:main.go):

- Listens on port 8555 by default
- Configurable TLS settings
- Shares certificate service with the main application

## Integration with Certificate Service

The ACME server is integrated with the certificate service:

- Uses the same CA for signing certificates
- Follows the same certificate lifecycle
- Certificate storage is consistent with manually issued certificates

## Using the ACME Server

Clients can interact with the ACME server using standard ACME clients:

```bash
# Example using certbot
certbot certonly --server https://localca.example:8555/acme/directory \
  --standalone -d example.local
```

For secure communication, clients should trust the CA certificate.

## Certificate Issuance Limitations

The ACME server enforces certain limitations:

- Domain validation is required through challenges
- Certificate validity periods match the CA's configuration
- Only domains allowed by the CA's policy can be issued
- Rate limiting may be applied to prevent abuse

## ACME Client Implementation

The LocalCA system will expand to include an ACME client for automatic certificate renewal:

- Certificate renewal process
- Challenge response automation
- Integration with the certificate lifecycle
