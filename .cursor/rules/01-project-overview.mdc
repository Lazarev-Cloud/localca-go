# LocalCA: Self-Hosted Certificate Authority

LocalCA is a complete solution for managing a private Certificate Authority within a local network. The project allows you to generate, manage, and deploy SSL/TLS certificates for internal services and clients.

## Core Features

- Certificate lifecycle management (create, renew, revoke, delete)
- Web-based dashboard for certificate operations
- Self-contained Certificate Authority (CA)
- Support for both server and client certificates
- Subject Alternative Name (SAN) support
- PKCS#12 export for client certificates
- Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
- Email notifications for expiring certificates
- ACME protocol support for automated certificate issuance

## Project Architecture

LocalCA follows a client-server architecture:

- Backend: Go-based API server that handles certificate operations
- Frontend: Next.js + React web interface
- Storage: File-based storage for certificates and configuration

The main entry point for the backend is [main.go](mdc:main.go), which initializes the configuration, storage, and certificate service.

The frontend starts at [app/page.tsx](mdc:app/page.tsx), which renders the main dashboard.

## Key Components

1. Certificate Service: Manages all certificate operations
   - [pkg/certificates/ca.go](mdc:pkg/certificates/ca.go): CA certificate management
   - [pkg/certificates/server.go](mdc:pkg/certificates/server.go): Server certificate operations
   - [pkg/certificates/client.go](mdc:pkg/certificates/client.go): Client certificate operations

2. Storage: Handles persistence of certificates and metadata
   - [pkg/storage](mdc:pkg/storage): Storage implementation

3. Web Interface: Next.js + React application
   - [app](mdc:app): Next.js app directory with pages and API routes
   - [components](mdc:components): Reusable React components

4. ACME Protocol Support: Automated certificate issuance
   - [pkg/acme](mdc:pkg/acme): ACME protocol implementation

5. Configuration Management:
   - [pkg/config](mdc:pkg/config): Application configuration handling
