# Deployment and Configuration

LocalCA can be deployed using Docker or built from source. The application is configured using environment variables.

## Deployment Options

- [docker-compose.yml](mdc:docker-compose.yml) - Docker Compose configuration
- [Dockerfile](mdc:Dockerfile) - Docker build instructions
- [DEPLOYMENT.md](mdc:DEPLOYMENT.md) - Detailed deployment instructions

## Configuration

The application is configured through environment variables:

- `CA_NAME` - Name of the Certificate Authority (FQDN)
- `CA_KEY_FILE` - Path to the file containing the CA key password
- `CA_KEY` - Direct CA key password (alternative to CA_KEY_FILE)
- `ORGANIZATION` - Organization name for the CA
- `COUNTRY` - Country code for the CA
- `STORAGE_PATH` - Path where certificates are stored
- `EMAIL_NOTIFY` - Enable email notifications for expiring certificates
- `SMTP_SERVER` - SMTP server for notifications
- `SMTP_PORT` - SMTP port
- `SMTP_USER` - SMTP username
- `SMTP_PASSWORD` - SMTP password
- `SMTP_USE_TLS` - Use TLS for SMTP
- `EMAIL_FROM` - From address for notification emails
- `EMAIL_TO` - Default recipient for notification emails
- `TLS_ENABLED` - Enable HTTPS for the web interface

## Security Considerations

- The application should be deployed in a secure internal network
- The CA private key should be kept secure
- TLS should be enabled for the web interface
- Regular backups of the CA and certificates should be maintained
