# Security Model

LocalCA implements a comprehensive security model to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the Certificate Authority and its issued certificates.

## Certificate Authority Security

The CA root certificate and private key are protected through:

- **Password Protection**: The CA private key is encrypted with a password
- **Filesystem Permissions**: Strict filesystem permissions for sensitive files
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control for administrative operations

The CA implementation is located in [pkg/certificates/ca.go](mdc:pkg/certificates/ca.go).

## Authentication and Authorization

The web interface is protected by authentication:

- Initial setup requires a secure token
- Subsequent access requires authentication
- Session management with secure cookies
- CSRF protection for all forms

Authentication logic is implemented in [pkg/handlers/auth.go](mdc:pkg/handlers/auth.go).

## TLS Configuration

Secure TLS configuration is enforced:

- TLS 1.2/1.3 only
- Strong cipher suites
- Modern elliptic curve preferences
- ECDHE key exchange

TLS configuration is defined in [main.go](mdc:main.go).

## Network Security

LocalCA is designed for internal network use:

- Not recommended for exposure to the public internet
- HTTPS support for secure management interface access
- Network isolation via Docker for containerized deployments

## Credential Management

Secure handling of credentials:

- No hardcoded credentials
- Environment variables for configuration
- Secure storage of generated certificates
- Password protection for client certificate exports

## Certificate Validation

Certificate security features:

- Strong key sizes (default: RSA 2048-bit or ECC P-256)
- Modern signature algorithms
- Certificate Revocation List (CRL) for revoked certificates
- Appropriate certificate extensions

## Security Best Practices

The [BestPractice.md](mdc:BestPractice.md) document outlines recommended security practices for:

- Certificate deployment
- Private key protection
- Trust chain management
- Certificate revocation management

## Audit Logging

Security events are logged for audit purposes:

- Certificate creation/revocation events
- Authentication attempts
- Administrative actions
- System startup and shutdown
