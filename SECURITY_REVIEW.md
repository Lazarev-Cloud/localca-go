# LocalCA Security Review & Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security review and fixes applied to the LocalCA project to ensure all frontend-backend connections are secure and functional.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. API Endpoint Consistency & Security
**Issue**: Inconsistent API routing between frontend and backend
**Fix**: 
- Unified all frontend API calls to use the `/api/proxy` pattern
- Added proper authentication status endpoint
- Fixed download endpoints to use consistent proxy paths

### 2. Authentication & Session Management
**Issue**: Missing authentication handlers and insecure session management
**Fix**:
- Added `apiAuthStatusHandler` for authentication status checks
- Implemented proper `apiLogoutHandler` with secure session cleanup
- Enhanced session validation with proper path checking
- Added secure cookie configuration

### 3. Input Validation & Sanitization
**Issue**: Insufficient input validation for certificate creation
**Fix**:
- Added comprehensive validation for Common Name (max 64 chars)
- Enhanced password validation (min 8 chars for client certs)
- Added domain name validation (max 255 chars per domain)
- Implemented duplicate certificate name checking

### 4. CORS & Security Headers
**Issue**: Basic CORS configuration without comprehensive security headers
**Fix**:
- Enhanced CORS middleware with environment-based origin control
- Added `apiSecurityMiddleware` with comprehensive security headers
- Implemented Content-Type validation for POST requests
- Added User-Agent header requirements

### 5. CSRF Protection
**Issue**: CSRF protection was implemented but not consistently applied
**Fix**:
- Maintained CSRF protection for web routes
- Exempted API routes from CSRF (as they use other authentication)
- Added proper token generation and validation

### 6. Error Handling & Information Disclosure
**Issue**: Potential information disclosure through error messages
**Fix**:
- Standardized API response format
- Added proper error handling with sanitized messages
- Implemented logging for security events

## Security Measures Implemented

### Backend Security (Go)

1. **Authentication Middleware**
   - Session-based authentication with secure token generation
   - Proper session file management with secure cleanup
   - Path validation to prevent directory traversal

2. **Input Validation**
   - Certificate name validation with length limits
   - Domain name validation
   - Serial number validation
   - Password strength requirements

3. **Security Headers**
   ```go
   c.Header("X-Content-Type-Options", "nosniff")
   c.Header("X-Frame-Options", "DENY")
   c.Header("X-XSS-Protection", "1; mode=block")
   c.Header("Cache-Control", "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, private")
   ```

4. **CORS Configuration**
   - Environment-based origin control
   - Configurable allowed methods and headers
   - Secure credential handling

### Frontend Security (Next.js)

1. **API Proxy Pattern**
   - All API calls route through secure proxy
   - Proper cookie forwarding
   - Error handling with retry logic

2. **Authentication Flow**
   - Proper setup detection and redirection
   - Session validation before API calls
   - Automatic logout on authentication failure

3. **Input Validation**
   - Client-side validation before API calls
   - Sanitized error messages to users
   - Proper loading states during operations

## API Endpoints Secured

### Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /api/login` - User authentication with session management
- `GET /api/setup` - Initial setup information
- `POST /api/setup` - Complete initial setup
- `GET /api/auth/status` - Authentication status check
- `POST /api/logout` - Secure logout with session cleanup

### Certificate Management
- `GET /api/certificates` - List all certificates
- `POST /api/certificates` - Create new certificate (with validation)
- `POST /api/revoke` - Revoke certificate
- `POST /api/renew` - Renew certificate
- `POST /api/delete` - Delete certificate

### System Information
- `GET /api/ca-info` - CA certificate information
- `GET /api/settings` - System settings
- `POST /api/settings` - Update system settings

### Downloads
- `GET /api/download/ca` - Download CA certificate
- `GET /api/download/crl` - Download Certificate Revocation List
- `GET /api/download/:name/:type` - Download specific certificate files

## Button Functionality Verified

### Dashboard Header
- ✅ Logout button - Properly clears session and redirects
- ✅ Download CA button - Downloads CA certificate via proxy
- ✅ Download CRL button - Downloads CRL via proxy
- ✅ Refresh certificates - Updates certificate list

### Quick Actions
- ✅ Create Certificate - Navigates to certificate creation
- ✅ Download CA Certificate - Downloads via secure proxy
- ✅ Refresh CRL - Updates data and shows status
- ✅ Settings - Navigates to settings page

### Certificate Table
- ✅ Download button - Downloads certificate files
- ✅ Renew button - Renews certificates with validation
- ✅ Revoke button - Revokes certificates with confirmation
- ✅ Delete button - Deletes certificates with confirmation

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Defense in Depth**
   - Multiple layers of validation (frontend + backend)
   - Authentication at multiple levels
   - Input sanitization at all entry points

2. **Secure Communication**
   - HTTPS support with modern TLS configuration
   - Secure cookie flags
   - Proper CORS configuration

3. **Session Security**
   - Cryptographically secure session tokens
   - Session expiration (8 hours)
   - Proper session cleanup on logout

4. **Input Validation**
   - Server-side validation for all inputs
   - Length limits on all text fields
   - Format validation for domain names and certificates

5. **Error Handling**
   - No sensitive information in error messages
   - Proper logging for audit purposes
   - Graceful degradation on errors

## Testing Completed

1. **Build Verification**
   - ✅ Frontend builds successfully
   - ✅ Backend compiles without errors
   - ✅ No linting errors

2. **API Connectivity**
   - ✅ All API routes properly configured
   - ✅ Proxy routes correctly forward requests
   - ✅ Authentication flow works end-to-end

3. **Security Headers**
   - ✅ Security headers present on all API responses
   - ✅ CORS properly configured
   - ✅ Content-Type validation working

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Rate Limiting**: Implement proper rate limiting middleware
2. **Monitoring**: Add comprehensive logging and monitoring
3. **Backup**: Implement secure backup procedures for certificates
4. **Updates**: Regular security updates for dependencies
5. **Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular security assessments

## Conclusion

The LocalCA application has been comprehensively reviewed and secured. All frontend-backend connections are now properly authenticated, all buttons are functional, and comprehensive security measures have been implemented throughout the application stack.

The application now follows security best practices and is ready for production deployment with proper monitoring and maintenance procedures in place.
